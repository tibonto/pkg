        <h1>Use case</h1>

        <p>A general use case of the PKG ontology is in the context of collaborative searching as learning scenarios.
            More and more often, students use search engines to learn more about a specific subject. However, the large
            number of documents provided as search results constitutes an obstacle. Students have to read, understand,
            analyse all the results. Search engines support their users in performing keyword-based searches, but they
            do not provide functionalities specifically designed to facilitate students’ searches for learning tasks <a href="#ref1">[1]</a>.
            Moreover, the collaboration between users is not enabled, hindering the possibility of implementing project-based
            learning or team-based learning activities. The PKG ontology can facilitate collaborative search and collaborative
            learning by creating Personal Knowledge Graphs in the backend of a system application.</p>

        <p>In particular, a specific use case of the PKG ontology has been integrated within the Learnweb e-learning
            platform <a href="#ref2">[2]</a><a href="#ref3">[3]</a>. Learnweb is a platform supporting collaborative searching
            and learning, and our ontology assists the integration of a new visualisation interface <a href="#ref4">[4]</a>.
            In the backend of the application, the <em>SearchSession</em> related classes are integrated via the classical
            search interface of Learnweb, and the <em>InputStream</em> is created. Then the stream is passed to the DBpedia
            Spotlight <a href="#ref5">[5]</a> software, which generates the <em>RecognizedEntities</em> from the DBpedia
            Knowledge Graph. This output is then processed together with the data gathered during the user’s activity,
            and the <em>SharedObject</em> is produced concerning <em>Accessibility</em> parameters. Finally, this object is shared with
            the Learnweb user interface, in which the summary of the users’ actions during a collaborative search activity
            is shown. Based on the algorithmic analysis, the display shows the most important entities that members are
            searching for related to the learning project they are collaborating on. The display is in graph form, with
            the nodes representing the core concepts of the search results and the edges showing how they are interconnected.</p>
